# SoundCorrection
Sound correction for home-made speakers.
Don't ask me too much, it follows this website instructions (french): https://www.petoindominique.fr/php/pc_plan_experience.php

Sound mesures should be on a 'data' folder and run script.py will create a 'data_results.txt'.

It can also be plotted running Affichage.py, a figure will be saved in the main folder, called 'resultat.png'
